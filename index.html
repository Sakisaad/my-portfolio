    <section id="intro">
        <p>Hi, I’m Mosaad Jawish, a senior majoring in Social Media Management who’s constantly thinking about how new technologies and trends intersect with the PR world. I recently dove into Scott’s book, “The New Rules of Marketing & PR Updated 8th revision.” The book covers a range of topics related to marketing and public relations, but I wanted to focus on two key sections: AI and Machine Learning and Newsjacking. I believe these topics are not just “trends” but fundamental shifts in how we work, and understanding how to leverage these tools can set you apart in the industry.</p>

        <h2>Section 1: Understanding Newsjacking in Marketing and PR</h2>
        
        <h3>What is Newsjacking?</h3>
        <p>Brands use a tactic known as "news-jacking" to increase their visibility and relevance by interjecting themselves into current affairs or popular news. Scott shares an example of a museum company taking advantage of the media talking about museums, using news-jacking to become relevant the next day.</p>
        
        <h3>My Personal Experience with Newsjacking on YouTube</h3>
        <p>As a YouTube channel manager, I can attest to the importance of speed and consistency in drawing viewers in. Timing is essential when it comes to news-jacking. For instance, I would post a One Piece chapter review as soon as a new chapter was published, and I would immediately receive a hundred views, particularly if I included chapter spoilers. This occurred because larger content creators frequently wait for the complete information to be released. However, by releasing the content ahead of schedule, I was able to take advantage of the surge in interest and increase my following.</p>
        
        <p>However, when I was late with uploads, I also noticed the opposite effect. Consider these two videos that I produced: The first was for Chapter 1129 of One Piece, and the second was for Chapter 1130. Only 16 people watched the video for Chapter 1129, which was posted two days after the chapter was released. However, Chapter 1130 received 113 views when I released it earlier, which was clearly boosted by the fact that it was posted at the right time. The editing and thumbnails were fairly comparable, so the main distinction was how quickly I released the information.</p>
        
        <p>I would counter that with the more general point: most people use social media to consume content that is relevant to their current moment. Some of you may argue that this example originates from the anime industry. Consider managing an Instagram account dedicated to climate change. I could release a timely video discussing the speech of a prominent political figure if I waited for them to talk on the subject of climate change. Eventually, my content would be found by others looking for that politician's statement. I would gain credibility and expand my following if I did this on a consistent basis. It all comes down to quickly and consistently grasping the opportunity.</p>

        <h3>Why Newsjacking Works</h3>
        <p>The success of Newsjacking lies in its timing. When done right, it allows brands to capture a moment’s energy, creating viral content that speaks to current trends. For example, imagine creating anime-related content the moment a new trend or event occurs in the anime industry—this would be an excellent example of how Newsjacking can boost your brand’s visibility.</p>

        <h3>Risks of Poorly Executed Newsjacking</h3>
        <p>While Newsjacking can be highly effective, it’s important to execute it consistently. As I learned from my own YouTube channel, failing to stay on top of timely content can prevent you from fully capitalizing on the moment. I wasn’t able to grow my channel as much as I could have simply because I couldn’t always post consistently. It’s a lesson I’ve carried with me: speed matters, but so does consistency.</p>
        
        <p>Engaging with subjects that are inconsistent with a brand's identity or values poses an additional risk. For instance, it wouldn't make sense for me to start reporting on political events if I were creating content on anime. My main audience comes for anime-related content, thus it would turn them off. Similarly, a fashion company's credibility may be harmed, and their audience confused, if they abruptly made political pronouncements unrelated to their brand or products.</p>

        <p>Executing Newsjacking well requires a balance of being timely, relevant, and staying true to your brand’s identity. Without this balance, your audience may not know what to expect from you, and your efforts will fall flat. It’s crucial to remember that Newsjacking carries certain risk factors. Brands risk backlash when they capitalize on popular subjects that don't fit with their identity or core beliefs. For example, even though the news may appear relevant, a corporation with a serious, professional image might not earn favor by making light of a catastrophe. Your viewers may become resentful of this discrepancy. Make sure that the tone of your brand is consistent with the subject matter you are discussing.</p>
